FUTURE POSTS & PROJECTS
 - 2D convolutional networks on stock data
  * Get data for sector ETFs, maybe, then try to predict s&p change over the next month or something.
  * Use tidyquant library to get stock data.
  
 - R packages validate & errorlocate (successors to editrules)
 
 - Visualizing resources that go into electric cars vs global mining
  * Especially current rate of electric car purchases vs all U.S. cars
  * Need amount of resources per car battery system.
  
 - Do models overfit to individual stocks?
  * Reference post for ARIMAs - https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-market-forecasting-using-time-series-c3d21f2dd37f
  * Maybe for LSTMs, too
  
 - A more involved example of Metropolis-Hastings MCMC
  * Logistic regression worked for ST502 project 2, probably want something similar.
  
 - Run through of showing bias in least squares variable selection.
  * From ST503 HW4, problem 7; also https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02379.pdf
  
 - Mapping thing using SeeClickFix
 
 - Visualizing calorie contents and prices of snacks and fruits
  * Need to collect data on prices from a grocery store
  * Get as much nutritional info as I can from things in-store, but will probably need to use the Internet to find some of it.
  * May want to see if the local paper would like it as well...
  * Supposed to be practice for using D3.
  
 - Something about pdftotext as a utility?
 
 - Keywords in patent data
 
 - Restore the IEEE article clustering code
  * Try out more clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical, (H)DBSCAN).
  * Want a way to quickly look at common keywords in the cluster.
  
 - Consumer complaints data (https://opendata.fcc.gov/Consumer/CGB-Consumer-Complaints-Data/3xyp-aqkj)
 
 - Length of Wikipedia article on Coronavirus outbreak
  * Need way to see when info is split off into subpages (if it is)
  * Would need to consider looking at other related pages (e.g., ones per nation)
  
 - FFTs in Python
  * If I can reverse engineer whatever it is at work...
  
 - Something about the transience of popular topics in the news
  * Requires dataset of articles from news sources
  
 - Animate a visualization of historical data for the progress of various World Community Grid projects over the years
  * Would be continuously scrolling, with data flowing right to left as it got older
  * Unsure whether to make it a percentage of total usage (probably) or maybe a stacked chart, or create separate visualizations of the two
  
 - Is there a way to look at text document changes using git?
  * Would need a document that was edited many times in a variety of ways, not just having stuff added onto the end
  * Would also need a way to visualize those changes
  * Maybe look at similarity over time (i.e., similarity metric some number of commits into past and future).
  
 - Comparison of the amount of data sent when searching on Google vs DuckDuckGo or something.
  * Maybe also do between browsers; would probably want work laptop for that, in order to get current versions of Google Chrome and Firefox (Chrome is available on Linux...)
  * Need to be able to intercept outgoing packets; that one Python talk had some stuff along those lines
  * Would be nice to be able to tell what kind of information is contained in those packets
  * Would need to account for Google sending search suggestions to and fro, since that would make for a less fair comparison.
  
 - Topics of Arxiv/Psyarxiv papers
  * Personal interest in the latter WRT depression
  * May be able to use this Arxiv scraper: https://github.com/Mahdisadjadi/arxivscraper
  * Psyarxiv: https://psyarxiv.com/
  
 - Differences in distributions of ratings
  * Kullback-Leibler divergence or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
  * Maybe similar Amazon products or IMDB series?
  
 - Something with https://opendata.guilfordcountync.gov
  * The flyer from CFGSO said that they want to "elevate stories of people that use data to improve and help the communities they live, work, and play in" and to get in touch if you have an idea (crystal@stae.co).
  
 - Overview of R's patchwork package
  * Does some neat combining of figures in ggplot2.
  * Maybe do it in the context of visualizing stock data?
  
 - Edit history of PinePhone-related GitHub repositories
 
 - Analyze microloan site data
  * Regression or other statistical analyses would be good for demonstrating my abilities, and is appropriate considering I was in 503 recently...
  * Either Kiva or LendingClub had access to good data, it seemed.
  
 - Example of lack of fit test, based on chapter 8 in ST503 textbook.
  * Something like the cars dataset would be a good set to demonstrate on.
  
 - Something about basic scraping with Python's newspaper library?
 
 - Description of how link functions in GLMs work/are derived.
 
 - Something with GGally? (extension of ggplot2)
 
 - Simulating a drive home (including stoplights) with Python's SimPy library
  * Trying to figure out how much of an effect speed has on travel time.
  * Tutorial post for Python's simpy library (may be useful) - https://realpython.com/simpy-simulating-with-python/
  
 - Speed of code for jackknife method versus the bootstrap.
 
 - Basic Shiny app displaying data from NOAA.
  * They've got detailed hour-by-hour data in text form (e.g. https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=36.0444&lon=-79.9421&lg=english&&FcstType=digital)
  * Unsure how to access it via API yet.
  
 - Basic stock report using rmarkdown to PDF.
  * Maybe a good chance to bring in patchwork as well?
  
 - Something with Pearson chi-squared test and Benford's law
  * Would prefer something with large numbers of easy-to-process numbers, e.g., accounting scandals.
  * Enron data set it at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/, should contain plenty of numbers
  
 - Something on the full set of pipes in R's magrittr package
 
 - Comparing the proportion of rainy days or amount of precipitation over the weekend for various U.S. counties
  * Could be good for a Bayesian surprise map, with the prior being the overall avg # of rainy days / amount of precipitation
  * Probably where historical NOAA data comes in.
  
 - Political alignments of companies based on FCC filings
  * Lotta NLP
  * Need to find that site again...
  
 - Look at Spotify metric for billboard 100 over years
  * Need to know what metrics Spotify assigns songs - I know there are ones like energy or valence that vary from 0 to 1
  * Something involving the wrapped normal distribution for metrics that go from 0 to 1?
  
 - Document clustering and extractive summaries of psychology papers (maybe with a focus on depression)
  * Need that psyarxiv scraper...
  * Also a lot of NLP...
  * Needs cluster visualization method(s)
  
 - Something on Yule processes
 
 - Something about the fractured nature of Linux (or general OSS) contributions
  * Would need data from Github or such about contribution history
  * Would need data on several fairly different distros/projects (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint, ???)
  
 - Actual effect of interaction terms in GLMs
  * Need to find that blog post about how GLMs already have interaction stuff built in
  
 - Ease of detecting when PDF files have additional files fused on
  * Need to figure out how to do that...
  * Would require a fairly similar set of papers to be successful - stuff scraped from Arxiv on a single topic, maybe?
  * Not sure how meaningful this is - you'd need some way of knowing what the file size should be
  * Build model for predicting file size based on file parameters; test if real value is abnormal
  
 - Some kind of prediction/portfolio analysis using Docker and/or Kubeflow
  * Could probably get a couple posts out of it, covering both setting up the data side of it and other stuff
  * Unsure of what to predict/compute with it -- maybe some sort of market monitoring like the Tensorflow CNN on the sector data?
  
 - Similarity of Internet petitions for both the political left and right
  * Need a dummy email account
  * Probably need some additional security measures, which sounds paranoid, but just in case...
  * Would want a model that tried to predict which side a document belongs to
  * Would require some amount of named entity recognition to strip out specific names and see how that affects the clustering/prediction/whatever.
  
 - Something involving time series and population dynamics?
  * Lotka–Volterra equations (differential equations, but could be estimated with a time series analysis?)
  
 - Shiny app which takes a two Spotify playlists, one of songs you like, and generates recommendations from the second based on the first.
 
 - Confidence vs credible intervals, and when they're the same theoretically
  * Emphasize that they aren't interchangable



 
OTHER THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND
 - Try nodebox and rawgraphs for visualization assistance; the latter in particular keeps coming up on Data Stories, so it's probably got something to it. 
 - Not sure how many popular science blogs/magazines/etc have statistics articles, but I bet they could use some.
 - Alephdata
 - SimdJSON - high speed JSON operations, has wrapper for R (https://simdjson.org/)
 - QuantLib - open source library for quantitative finance, has Python & R bindings (https://www.quantlib.org/)
 - CRAN Views - collections of packages on a theme (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
